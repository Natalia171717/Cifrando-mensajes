## Message encryption with Haskell

### About the project
- The project was developed exclusively using Haskell.
- The project consists of several functions that encrypt the message provided by the user, using the Caesar cipher or the Vigen√®re cipher, in accordance with the [documentation](Documentation.pdf). The documentation is written in Spanish.
- The test file is located within the project. You can use it to add your own tests and try the program.
- To execute the project, it is necessary to have the Haskell compiler (GHC) installed on your device. You can then run the test file or invoke a specific function from the console.
